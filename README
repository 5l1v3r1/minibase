About the project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The code here builds into what is generally known as "early userspace",
or sometimes as "init system". A loose set of userspace tools meant to
bring the system up and keep it running.

To make a bootable Linux system, one needs the kernel and also some
userspace tools to load modules, locate devices, mount filesystems,
spawn services and so on. There are several package sets that provide
the necessary components, for instance:

  * kernel, glibc, sysvinit, bash, coreutils, kmod, mount, loginutils, ...
  * or kernel, glibc, dbus, systemd, kmod, ...
  * or kernel, musl and busybox
  * or kernel and minibase

This is a simplification and the list is incomplete, but it should
give the right idea of what minibase is.

The listed components form the base of the system. Their role is roughly
initialization, configuration and general support for the applications
running on top of the system. What exactly does that support mean differs
wildly between projects; minibase can be thought of as being in-between
busybox and systemd. The primary target for this project is a personal
computing device (a desktop or a laptop) running a GUI.

minibase builds into small static executables with no external dependencies
other than the kernel itself. Once built, these executables could be used
with any system targeting the same CPU architecture, regardless of which
libc the rest of the system uses. Static executables also never interfere
with shared library updates, providing a solid base to build the rest of
the system on.


Project status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The project is ONGOING but not yet complete or even stable.
Components currently included in the package:

  * batch command runner / script interpreter (msh)
  * early-stage boot utils (switchroot, modprobe, mount).
  * non-encrypted block device locator (findblk).
  * encrypted device locator and passphrase prompt (passblk).
  * support tooling for disk encryption (dektool, dmcrypt).
  - no fsck for any file system yet.

  * process supervision suite (init, super, reboot, svctl).

  * udev event monitor (udevmod).
  * syslogd and related tools.
  * non-privileged mount service (mountd, pmount).
  * controlled privilege escalation service (suhub, sudo)

  * VT/DRI/input multiplexer (vtmux)
  * simple non-graphical greeter (ctrlvt).

  * network interface monitor (ifmon)
  * DHCP client (dhcp)
  * Wi-Fi client and connection manager (wsupp) [WPA2-PSK only]
  * manual interface setup tools (ip4cfg, ip4info) [incomplete]
  - no sntpd yet.

  * simple interactive shell (cmd).
  * basic command line tools (cat, ls, du, df etc).
  * small linux-specific tools (systime, sync, dmesg etc).

  - no package manager / download tool yet.
  - no audio tools of any kind.

With everything in place, the system should boot on kernel and minibase alone
to the point where it can run X or Wayland GUI, connect to network and start
downloading packages.


Compiler and libc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To build minibase, get any gcc toolchain targeting the right CPU.
The compiler will be used with -nostdinc -nostdlib so it doesn't
matter which libc (if any) it was configured with.

Supported targets: x86_64 arm aarch64 rv64 mips mips64 i386.
Anything else won't work even if toolchain is available.


Quick start
~~~~~~~~~~~
Bootable images for QEMU (buildroot, minibase, Xorg, Weston) along
with the build scripts are maintained in a dedicated repository:

    https://github.com/arsv/minibase-br/

Get the latest sys-plain or sys-crypt from Releases, check included
instructions. Inspect the build scripts, rootfs and initrd contents
to understand how the system boots. Check doc/boot.txt here as well.

Start reading the sources at temp/compat, src/cmdops, src/init.

NOTE: minibase-br lags behind the master branch here.


How to build and run the tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For a proper build, run

    ./configure
    make
    make install     # default DESTDIR is ./out

To try the tools without setting up a VM, configure and build
the project in development mode:

    make clean
    ./configure devel
    make

Most tools can be run right from their source directories.


Feature highlights
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some features in no particular order.

Minibase comes with a proper service supervisor. (This is really
only worth mentioning because of inevitable attempts to compare
it to OpenRC).

Init process is staged, similar to s6 and runit but unlike SysV, systemd
and most other systems. The supervisor is unitary (same parent for all
child processes), similar to SysV and systemd but unlike s6, runit and
other daemontools derivatives.

There is no fstab in minibase, and no conventional mount(1).
The tools that handle mounts are written with hot-plugging in mind.

Minibase comes with a functional replacement for logind that is not
a fork or a clone of systemd-logind, and does not need dbus to work.

There are no conventional logins in minibase and no user passwords.
The passphrase entered during boot is used to unwrap disk encryption
keys. The system is assumed to run on a personal computing device
owned by its only human user.

Sessions are normally pre-configured and pinned to certain VTs.
Switching to a VT starts the session assigned to that particular VT.

Minibase does not use dbus, or any other system bus for that matter.
IPC is done point-to-point over unix sockets using simple netlink-
based protocol.

Minibase is meant to be run with suid bits disabled. Any privilege
escalation in a minibase system happens via IPC to privileged services.


Just how small exactly?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The largest individual executable so far is `wsupp`, the WPA supplicant.
Statically linked for x86_64, it's about 27 KiB in size. Realistically
it also needs `ifmon` (20 KiB) to work, and the client tool `wifi` (12 KiB).

`msh` is about 16 KiB. `cmd` (interactive shell) is about 18 KiB.
`super` (pid 1 for the majority of system's uptime) is about 10 KiB.
`vtmux` (logind equivalent) is about 12 KiB.

Why bother making it small? Because it's a side effect of making it readable.
The idea is that anyone could pick a tool from minibase, start reading it
and gain complete understanding of how it works in a very reasonable amount
of time, say hours. And if necessary, audit or debug it down to assembly level.
A major point in achieving this is making sure there are no unnecessary
wrappers, useless abstractions or dead code, which eventually translates
into small executables.


Contributing
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Do not send patches for minibase itself. Doing so will likely only slow
the project down. If there's a bug to be fixed, or a tool that you think
should be in minibase, open an issue. The ability to scrap and re-design
certain tools unimpeded is way too important for the project at this
stage.

Not every tool is worth including in mini-BASE. Just like in any other
case, it is perfectly ok to have dedicated repos and dedicated packages
for some tools, especially if different developers are involved.

The best way to actually contribute to the project is to write something
that would fit well alongside minibase in a running system. In most cases,
it likely won't even be tied to minibase, and would work just well in runit
or s6 or even systemd based installation.

Area of particular interest: lightweight GUI desktop components.
Something to run atop of X or Wayland once minibase gets you there.
This includes both the primary desktop and things like a nice GUI greeter
to replace `ctrlvt` which is really only a stub.


Licensing
~~~~~~~~~
GNU Public License version 3, see COPYING.
Limited closed-box license may or may not get added in the future.

The code in lib/sys, lib/bits and lib/arch constitutes the public interface
of the Linux kernel. No claims are made for that code, and it should not be
copyrightable anyway. If unsure, grab corresponding fragments from either
the kernel sources (GPLv2) or the musl libc (MIT license).

The code in lib/crypto is mostly BSD-licensed. See README there.

The project was heavily influenced by busybox at early stages.
Certain decision from skarnet/s6 project also played significant role.
Syscall code (static inline functions with asm volatile blocks)
follows musl, because musl folks got it right.

The Rust coreutils project provided great deal of inspiration,
specifically by showing how not to write coreutils.
