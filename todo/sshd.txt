Minimalistic SSH server; key-only auth with a single supported
key type (say Ed25519), and probably no advanced features like
port forwarding.

This would be a base-line remote access implementation, for cases
where building/installing a proper sshd is just too much and telnet
gets used instead. Also would be nice to have just to make minibase
only systems viable for SBCs.

This should not depend on dnresd at all.

Critical point: dropbear (with modifications to simplify build)
possibly makes this tool pointless.
