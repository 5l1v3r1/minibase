Simple NTP daemon, capable just enough to be able to set up time
on newly-booted host, and maybe keep it in sync.

Depends on usable dnresd.

Would be nice to try TAI for systime, with the NTP daemon being the only
entity dealing with the leap seconds in the timestamps. This would need
the "right" timezones (w/ leaps), also possibly adjusted to match TAI 0
point. Or maaybe just stick with TAI+10, although those 10 seconds will
not make it compatible with anything anyway as either TAI+0 or TAI+10
would result in all timestamps being ~30..40s out of sync with common
Linux systems.
