Current (second? third?) iteration of ifmon is already in place but there's
still lots of stuff that needs to be done there.

  * Custom iface configuration -- pretty much no way around this, ifmon
    needs some way to run arbitrary scripts whenever certain interfaces
    appear. Most likely similar to vtmux, /etc/ifmon/$name.
    Implementation likely depends on the following point

  * Interface renaming. Kernel stuff aside, lots of things become easier
    when users are able to give certain interfaces persistent names.
    It should be optional however. Wifi iface auto-pickup should still work,
    even with kernel names.

  * Some sort of iptables presets for autoconfed interfaces.
    Probably a dedicated tool to do this, and some way to configure it in
    ifmon? Absolutely a must for ipv6 support.

  * Primary interface selection and DHCP cross-locking. Current implementation
    allows bringing up two uplinks, and will use dhcp data from the last one.
    It should be arbitrated. Merely preventing the second uplink is probably
    not possible. May require common dhcp service, or maybe bringing DHCP code
    into ifmon.
