Two tools that would benefit a lot from static linkage: strace and gdbserver.

Both *should* be relatively easy to implement with modern ptrace().

Caveat: strace is very well written and can be used as is with static musl.
So while possible, it may not be immediately useful. Unless it would implement
something minibase-specific, like netlink/nlusctl decoder maybe.

Static gdbstub, on the other hand, should be immediately useful.
GDB is a GNU project with rather unpleasant dependencies.


Reference: qemu gdb code?
