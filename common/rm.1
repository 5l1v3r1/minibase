.SH NAME
rm \- remove files or directories
'''
.SH SYNOPSIS
rm [\fB-frx\fR] \fIfile\fR \fIfile\fR ...
'''
.SH DESCRIPTION
rm removes (deletes) specified files. Without \fB-r\fR, it does not remove
directories, even if empty. With \fB-r\fR, it removes the directories and
their contents recursively.
.P
Without \fB-f\fR, rm stops at the first error. rm never follows symlinks.
rm refuses to delete / unless \fB-R\fR is given.
.P
Unless \fB-x\fR is given, rm does not cross filesystem boundaries. Any entries
removed recursively under each of the \fIfile\fR argument must have the same
st_dev per \fBstat\fr(2) as the \fIfile\fR argument itself.
'''
