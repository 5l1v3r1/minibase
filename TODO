Big fat warning: POSIX compatibility is *NOT* a goal!

The goal is providing a set of tools that allow one to do the stuff
possible in POSIX, if perhaps with different commands, while keeping
the executables small and the code clean.


* cp, mv, ln?
	ln to do symlinks by default, maybe?

* chvt
	this one should also do deallocvt and openvt, all that fits nicely
	within a single too. Probably should be called "vt" as well.

* reset and/or tset

* ls and stat
	ls should probably be list-only tool, and all traditional ls -l
	stuff should go to stat instead. And instead of ls -lR it should
	look something like this:
		ls -r | stat -i		# stat reads stdin and does basename
		ls -r | xargs -d stat
	
* xargs
	should split on linebreaks by default	

* hexdump
	with a sane common format, *not* the stuff od does.

* wr (or wrt? or write?)
	replace current write with a generic tool that writes to a file (and/or
	stdout) the data read from stdin or files gives or the args themselves.
	That's all quite similar actually. This tool would replace echo, cat and tee.

* dd (or bcp?)
	naturally with sane syntax, i.e.
		dd -b 1M outfile.bin infile.bin
	instead of
		dd bs=1M of=outfile.bin if=infile.bin

* merge mount and umount?
	Seems quite natural but turns out to be really contrieved.
	The tools are almost completely unrelated, *and* have a lot
	of option overlap. The idea is of course to make

		mount -u /mntpoint

	do unmounting.
	
* ifconfig / ip / iw / arp? maybe iptables?
