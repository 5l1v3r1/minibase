Why connection manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There's a gazillion ways to configure the Linux networking stack
(and the interfaces the kernel provides generally reflect that).

For a vast majority of personal computing devices however, there
are only few that matter: a fully autoconfed wifi connection, and
a fully autoconfed ethernet connection, one at a time.

The idea behind wimon is to provide the user with reasonably
usable interface for the most common laptop-like configuration:
a single wifi card, and a single ethernet port.


Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The problem turns out to be much more hairy than it looks like,
mostly because it's very unclear and open-ended. Below are some
notes on the decisions made.

* Support for GSM/CDMA/VPN/other kinds of networks.

  It would be really nice to split wifi support out, and allow *other*
  similar modules to be dropped in. The thing is, I have no idea how
  a good generic connection manager should look like, or whether such
  thing is possible at all.

  Different kinds of networks usually have wildly different configuration
  interfaces but usually must be orchestrated somehow to allow uplink
  switching. Wifi+ethernet is a very popular set of hardware that warrants
  dedicated support until a nice generic solution is found.

  VPNs in particular probably should not be managed by any network mgr
  at all. Like Tor but also like resolved and ntpd, it should probably
  be started by init, commanded by "network-up" event. See shoutd.txt.

* Why not strictly Wi-Fi monitor + another tool for Ethernet?

  Mostly because there's nothing specific about ethernet.
  Any sort of wifi tool should be able to configure ethernet
  interfaces as well, just by skipping the wifi part.

* More complex IP stack configuration?

  Setups that need complex IP configuration *probably* do not need
  user-configurable volatile connection monitors.

* Why support (or care about) multiple wifi or ethernet devices?

  It's very easy to get hardware configuration like that (just plug some
  USB dongle in) which without proper handling would lead to some really
  weird behavior.

  Multiple wifi cards also have some applications:

    - one card for 2.4GHz and one for 5GHz
    - one card for uplink, one card to share connection.

  Ethernet devices may not be ethernet at all. To wimon, any networking
  device that's not wifi would look like ethernet. Multiple ethernet ports
  also have proper applications, including uplink/downlink just like with
  wifi cards.

* Bluetooth support?

  Bluetooth has nothing in common with regular netdevs and should
  be managed with a separate tool. Which is planned by the way.

  (only mentioned here because NetworkManager apparently supports it)

Should be mentioned also that in Linux network devices aren't devices,
and are not handled by udevd. This means that whatever monitors them
has to do things like user access checks, *if* it's applicable.
Same goes for bluetooth.


How a proper split module setup might look like
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The common scheme (employed by e.g. NetworkManager) is to have connection
manager in front of the individual modules, and a common ui:

                              | -----> 3g-mod ------> device
                              |
       uitool ----> conn-mgr -| -----> wifi-mod ----> nl80211
                              |
                              | -----> vpn-mod -----> remote

The key point here is that conn-mgr knows how to instantiate the backend
modules. The UI part only needs to talk to conn-mgr, everything else is
more or less hidden behind it.

The big flaw in this design is that conn-mgr (and very like uitool) must
support to some degree *all* possible backend modules. Generally it is
impossible to add a new module without at least re-building conn-mgr.
This would not be acceptable for minitools.

A different idea is to reverse the scheme:
                               
       wifi-tool ----> wifi-mgr ------> nl80211
                            |     
       3g-tool ------> 3g-mgr --------> device
                          | |     
       vpn-tool------> vpn-mgr -------> remote
                          |||
                          vvv
       conn-tool ..... conn-mgr

Here the only task of conn-mgr is being a mutex, preventing unrelated managers
from bringing their respective connections up concurrently. Each manager is
started independently of conn-mgr by e.g. init.

The key point here is that conn-mgr passively accepts uniform requests from
individual modules, and most of the active communication bypasses it.

This way adding a new module is trivial, however pretty much any cross-module
actions become really difficult. In particular, {wifi,3g,vpn}-tool will likely
also need to talk to conn-mgr in order to switch active connection to their
respective mgr.

# Side note, it is quite possible to merge the two schemes so that the whole
# thing continues to work like scheme #2 but all the tools talk to the same
# endpoint like in scheme #1. One option is to have conn-mgr multiplex the
# traffic somehow, effectively becoming a message bus hub. Another is to use
# a proper message bus hub, which is effectively what NetworkManager does
# anyway.

The role of conn-mgr in scheme #2 suggests that perhaps it should not even
be a process. Some sort of file locking may be enough. On the other hand,
if it is a process, it could do stuff like system re-configuration for the
new network.


The role of wimon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Does this whole thing deprecate wimon somehow?

Well not really. As mentioned above, wimon alone covers lots of use cases.
Devices which will never need to care about 3g, Wi-Max or anything that
isn't Wi-Fi or plain Ethernet.

And regardless of anything else, wimon will likely remain the lightest
solution for those devices. Ethernet support in wimon barely adds anything.
But extensive IPC in scheme #2 definitely does.
