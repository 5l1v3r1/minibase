The server (authenticator) part of the wpa exchange. Preferably done
in a way that would allow running it just like 'wpa' from wimon, to
mimic Android's hotspot config.

At this point it sholdn't even be that much harder to do than wpa or wimon.
Some netlink exchange, and then the key exchange over the interface.
All this multiplexed over several clients and timed for retries.

With reasonably maleable hostapd in place, the next step is clearly
a better key exchnage for client-AP connections in a form suitable
for general usage. ECDHE, either with PSK as a drop-in wpa replacement,
or with some asymmetric auth scheme.
Unclear atm: SAE/Dragonfly for client-AP usage.


Another "neat" idea: transmit IPs in the last key exchange message,
eliminating the need for DHCP. Makes lots of sense for wifi connections,
but requires tight co-operation between hostapd and (presumably) dhcpd
on the AP side if wired and wireless clients share the same address space.

OTOH, no way to transmit the other data that normally goes with DHCP,
like the DNS addresses. Or captive portal addresses were they done the
right way. On yet another hand, only DNS field sees any actual usage
and there are lots of reasons to get rid of that.
