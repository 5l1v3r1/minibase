DNS resolver daemon. Mostly to move gethostbyname out of libc.
Listens for requests on /run/dns, does DNS stuff, replies back.

With this in place, gethostbyname() should devolve into a simple
socket-connect-send-recv sequence, with little to no parsing and
definitely no config reading and such.

Configuration: unclear. All things considered, it would be great
to have some sort of zero-config, so root queries, so probably not
that good. Lacking that, something really static like 8.8.8.8, but
again that's Google so not good either. Querying 192.168.1.1 in home
network should be an option too.

So most likely same as with sntpd, servers in command line, and
startup script to pull them from whatever place necessary.

Relying on DHCP is tricky. DHCP to write to some pre-defined location
(like /run/dhcp.conf) and the startup script to pick it there?
