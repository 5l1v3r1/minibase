Virtual consoles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Or, how do I run Xorg or Wayland?

The primary component that enables GUIs in this project is vtmux, the VT
multiplexer. It runs as a system service, and spawns processes like Xorg
or Wayland compositors, providing them with the access to DRM (monitor
outputs) and input devices. Here's an example of how the relevant part
of the process tree should look like:

    1 svhub          # top-level supervisor
     \
      +- vtmux       # system service, see startup.txt
       \
        +- Xorg      # display 0, runs on VT1
	+- Xorg      # display 1, runs on VT3
	+- weston    # and this one let's say VT5
	+- rootsh    # bare Linux terminal on VT10

There may be several of these processes running at once, but only one will
be active at a time, showing something on the monitor(s) and getting input
events. This is the "multiplexer" part of vtmux.

Another way to put it is to say that each of these processes "runs on" a
virtual terminal (VT) and vtmux switches between the VTs, mapping one VT
at a time onto the real devices. That's not how it really works in modern
Linux, but it makes for a nice mental model.


Starting vtmux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Typical contents of /etc/svhub/vtmux:

    #!/sbin/msh

    exec vtmux 3

The argument is the default VT. On startup, vtmux switches to the specified
VT, starting the client there.


Configuring VTs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The idea with vtmux is to pin particular configurations to particulars VTs.

Example: if VT3 is configured to run Xorg/fluxbox, then every time the user
switches to VT3 with C-A-F3, it would be Xorg with fluxbox. And if say VT5
is Xorg/i3, then C-A-F5 would always bring up Xorg/i3, and same with say
Weston on VT7 or a root shell on a bare Linux console on VT10.

The choice of VTs to configure is arbitrary. It is perfectly fine to have
only VT1, VT5 and VT10; vtmux will refuse to switch to VTs that are not
configured.

Clients are spawned on demand. If the user switches to a configured VT,
but the process is not running there, vtmux will attempt to start it.
Clients are allowed to exit normally (Xorg example: exiting from a wm),
vtmux will just switch off from that VT. Re-entering the same VT would
respawn the client.


Client scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The way clients are defined for vtmux is similar to svhub: a script in
a pre-defined directory which vtmux will exec() in a forked process.

Example, say from VT5, would be /etc/vtmux/tty5:

    #!/sbin/msh

    setenv USER user
    setenv HOME /home/user
    setenv SHELL /sbin/cmd
    
    cd $HOME
    
    groups control
    setgid $USER
    setuid $USER
    
    setenv XDG_RUNTIME_DIR /tmp/$USER
    
    mkdir $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR 0700 $USER:$USER
    
    setenv WESTON_TTY_FD 0
    setenv WESTON_LAUNCHER_SOCK 3
    
    waitfor /dev/dri/card0
    
    exec /usr/bin/weston

The clients are spawned with fds 0, 1 and 2 pointing to a matching /dev/ttyN
device, and fd 3 being a communication channel (a socket, see socketpair(2))
back to vtmux, running weston-launch protocol. That's what WESTON_LAUNCHER_SOCK
is in the example above.

Just like with svhub, the scripts are spawned with root uid and must drop
unnecessary privileges. When running under vtmux, clients do *not* need
extra privileges to access DRM or input devices, only the control channel
on fd 3. Running clients as root is a VERY BAD IDEA and may disrupt vtmux
itself among other things.

Some (most?) clients abort if no DRM devices are available during initial
device scan. When a graphics-capable system boots, the first client may get
started before DRM modules finish their initialization and fail instantly.
As a simple workaround, `waitfor` is used to pause script until the first
DRM device appears.


Graphical clients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to work properly, graphical clients MUST follow the weston-launch
protocol over the control channel on fd 3 to access DRM and input devices.

Weston supports it out of the box.
Xorg MUST BE PATCHED to work with vtmux.

Other clients probably require patches as well.

This protocol is DIFFERENT from the one logind uses; vtmux DOES NOT support
logind protocol and CANNOT run clients configured for logind only.

For information on the protocol itself, see ../src/vtms/proto.txt.


Non-graphical clients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Clients that do not use the fd 3 control channel MUST close it.

    #!/sbin/msh
    
    close 3   # <-- important!
    
    cd /
    
    setenv PATH "/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin"
    
    exec /sbin/cmd

Leaking fd 3 is a low-key security threat, as possession of this fd allows
effectively gives the process DRM mastering capability.

# That said, leaving it open would allow running something like Xorg
# manually from that particular shell, which may be useful for debugging.

This issue is mostly limited to shells running on bare Linux TTYs.


Keyboard control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The only way to initiate VT switch with vtmux is to send it a command over
its control socket, /run/ctrl/vtmux. On its own, vtmux does not handle key
events, and disables handling of C-A-Fn combos in the kernel.

Starting vtmux alone actually *disables* C-A-Fn!

That's intentional and there are technical reasons for doing so. For once,
this makes it (relatively) easy to change combos in use, as well as to bind
unusual ones like C-A-Esc for the greeter.

The service that handles keyboard events in this project is keymon.
Relevant parts in /etc/keymon:

    C-A-Esc: vtctl 0
    C-A-F1: vtctl 1
    C-A-F2: vtctl 2
    C-A-F3: vtctl 3
    C-A-F4: vtctl 4
    C-A-F5: vtctl 5
    # and the rest if necessary

Like vtmux, keymon a system service and needs to be started during system boot.


Configuring greeter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Greeter is just a regular client assigned to non-existent "VT0".
Its client script is /etc/vtmux/tty0. It actually gets spawned on some
high-numbered VT normally not accessible from keyboard, like VT13.

Greeter is what vtmux attempts to switch to without an explicit argument.
When greeter exists, vtmux switches to the last non-greeter VT (that is,
the one the greeter was "called" from).

Greeter is supposed to be used as a DE-independent way of performing
privileged actions like requesting shutdown, putting the system to sleep
and so on.
