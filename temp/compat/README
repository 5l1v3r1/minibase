This directory contains implementations of well-known commands
which somehow do not fit in the minibase set (superseeded, pointless,
made into msh builtins). They still may be used to replace bloatier
equivalents outside of minibase scope.

One of the reason a command may end up here is that its primary use
is in shell scripting, for stuff that really should be a part of the
scripting language and not a standlone process.

Some of the commands are simplified compared to GNU/POSIX equivalents,
and some were written as sketches to test the library.
