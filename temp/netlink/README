It is often much easier to decode NL packets than to get through
iproute2 code that generates them. A simple way to dump packets
is strace -e write=3 (or whatever fd happens to be the NL socket).
Convert resulting hexdump to raw binaries using hex2bin.px, then
dump the contents with rtdump.

There's no way for the dumper to tell whether the packet came
from RTNL or from GENL. The right tool and the right nl_dump_*()
must be used to get usable results.


Expected hex2bin input example:

 | 00000  34 00 00 00 18 00 05 06  bb d0 84 58 00 00 00 00  4..........X.... |
 | 00010  02 18 00 00 fe 03 00 01  00 00 00 00 08 00 01 00  ................ |
 | 00020  01 01 01 00 08 00 05 00  0a 00 00 01 08 00 04 00  ................ |
 | 00030  03 00 00 00                                       ....             |
