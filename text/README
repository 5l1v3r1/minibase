The tools here are primarily building blocks for scripts.
Their interaction with the system is limited to read(0, ...),
write(1, ...) and write(2, ...).

The distinction is not that important actually, so it is mostly
about separating common system tools (cp, ls, mkdir and such)
which are build around specific syscalls, and the stuff that
mostly works on piped text.
