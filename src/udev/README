This directory contains two versions of essentially the same tool.
The larger one, udevmod, is a regular long-running never-exiting service
for general use. The second, smaller one (devinit) is meant for initrd
use only and does normally exit.

Both tools run modprobe whenever kernel reports a new modaliased device.
udevmod also implements some libudev compatibility behavior (to allow
running unmodified X and Weston atop of it) and minimalistic device node
chmod/chown which has no use atm and should be removed at some point.
