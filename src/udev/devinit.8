'''
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdevinit\fR [\fIbase-dir\fR]
.P
With no \fIbase-dir\fR specified, \fBdevinit\fR will look for its scripts
in the root directory.
'''
.SH DESCRIPTION
This a simple tool that only does two things:
.IP "*" 2
starts a script, \fIbase-dir\fR/devinit, and waits for it to finish;
.IP "*" 2
keeps probing modaliases while the script is running.
.P
\fBdevinit\fR is only meant to be used in initrd environment. The script it
runs should be waiting for the system partitions while devinit is loading
modules for the device containing them. Once the script exits, so does the
tool itself.
