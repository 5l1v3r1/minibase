'''
.SH DESCRIPTION
mount replaces visible contents of \fItarget\fR directory with some other
file subtree. Typical invocation attaches a \fIfstype\fR filesystem tree
contained on block device \fIsource\fR, with optional \fIdata\fR passed
to the filesystem driver.
.P
With relevant options, mount can also attach existing directory trees
at different locations, and change mount options for already-mounted
filesystems. 
'''
.SH OPTIONS
Any combination of the options below must be squashed into a single argument:
\fB-rdx\fR is accepted but \fB-r -d -x\fR is not.
.IP "\fB-u\fR" 4
Detach each \fItarget\fR by calling \fBumount\fR(2). If used, this must be
the first option, as it changes the way the following options are interpreted.
.P
Without \fB-u\fR, the options set bits in \fBmountflags\fR argument for
\fBmount\fR(2). These flags are common for all filesystems; any filesystem-specific
settings are passed via \fIdata\fR which is a comma-separated list of keys
or \fIkey\fR=\fIvalue\fR pairs.
.IP "\fB-b\fR" 4
Perform a bind mount, making \fIsource\fR subtree visible at a different
location \fItarget\fR (MS_BIND).
.IP "\fB-m\fR" 4
Move existing mount point \fIsource\fR to a different location \fItarget\fR
(MS_MOVE).
.IP "\fB-r\fR" 4
Mount \fIsource\fR read-only (MS_RDONLY).
.IP "\fB-t\fR" 4
Enable reduced updates of inode timestamps (MS_LAZYTIME).
.IP "\fB-d\fR" 4
Do not allow access to device files on this filesystem (MS_NODEV).
.IP "\fB-x\fR" 4
Do not allow programs to be executed from this filesystem (MS_NOEXEC).
.IP "\fB-s\fR" 4
Do not honor set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits when executing programs
from this filesystem (MS_NOSUID).
.IP "\fB-e\fR" 4
Remount \fItarget\fR, possibly changing its mount options (MS_REMOUNT).
.IP "\fB-i\fR" 4
Suppress the display of certain messages in the kernel log (MS_SILENT).
.IP "\fB-y\fR" 4
Make writes on this filesystem synchronous (MS_SYNCHRONOUS).
.IP "\fB-v\fR" 4
Mount virtual file system (\fIsource\fR=NULL).
.P
With \fB-u\fR, the options set flags for \fBumount\fR(2):
.IP "\fB-f\fR" 4
Force unmounting (MNT_FORCE).
.IP "\fB-d\fR" 4
Perform a lazy unmount (MNT_DETACH).
.IP "\fB-x\fR" 4
Make mount point as expired (MNT_EXPIRE).
.IP "\fB-n\fR" 4
Do not follow symlinks (UMOUNT_NOFOLLOW).
