.SH NAME
msh \- mini shell
'''
.SH SYNOPSIS
msh [\fIscript\fR]
'''
.SH DESCRIPTION
msh is a non-interactive command interpreter capable of running simple
command sequences, and hardly anything else. It is indended to be used
in place of (much larger) POSIX shell in cases where the extra features
provided by the latter are not necessary.
'''
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
#!/bin/msh

# Variable assignment
VAR="some value"

# Running commands
kmod e1000e
echo "Module loaded"

# Variable substitution
echo $VAR

# Built-ins
exec /sbin/init
.fi
'''
.SH BUILTINS
These commands are run in the context of the shell process.

.IP "\fBwarn\fR \fImessage\fR" 4
Same, to stderr.
.IP "\fBsleep\fR \fIseconds\fR" 4

Replace current process with \fIcommand\fR. See \fBexecve\fR(2).
.IP "\fBopen\fR [\fB-rwacx\fR] \fIfd\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
Open \fIfile\fR and \fBdup2\fR(2) the result to \fIfd\fR.
Options: \fBr\fRead, \fBw\fRrite, \fBa\fRppend, \fBc\fRreate, e\fBx\fRclusively.
.IP "\fBclose\fR \fIfd\fR" 4
.IP "\fBdupfd\fR \fIold\fR \fInew\fR" 4

.IP "\fBumask\fR \fIvalue\fR" 4
.IP "\fBsetuid\fR \fIuser\fR" 4
Set real, effective and saved user ids to those of \fIuser\fR.
.IP "\fBsetgid\fR \fIgroup\fR" 4
Same with group ids.
.IP "\fBgroups\fR \fIgroup\fR \fIgroup\fR ..." 4
See \fBsetgroups\fR(2).
.IP "\fBsetprio\fR \fInumber\fR" 4
See \fBsetpriority\fR(2). The argument is in Linux units, 1-40.
.IP "\fBrlimit\fR \fIkey\fR \fIcur\fR [\fImax\fR]" 4
See \fBprlimit\fR(2). \fIKey\fR for \fBRLIMIT_CPU\fR is just \fBcpu\fR.
.IP "\fBseccomp\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
See \fBseccomp\fR(2), \fBSECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER\fR. The \fIfile\fR
is expected to contain compiled BPF opcodes.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP "PATH" 8
Colon-separated list of directories to look for commands,
see \fBexecvp\fR(3).
'''
.SH NOTES
Common POSIX shell features not supported in msh: redirections (>file),
pipes (|cmd), globbing (*), background execution (&), jobs, control flow
(if, while, case), advanced variable substituion (${var...}), backticks.
.P
Like make but unlike POSIX shell, msh aborts on the first failed command.
Prefix the command with \fB-\fR to proceed over failure.
.P
Variable references ($var) in msh are always treated as a single token
regardless of the stored value, more like "$var" works in POSIX shell.
Example: `ls $dir` will always run ls with a single argument, even if
$dir is an empty string, or a string with spaces.
