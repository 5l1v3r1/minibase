Networking tools are a pain to deal with in devel environment.

To have everything working as intended, wsupp must be running under ifmon,
sockmod (see ../misc/sockmod.c) must be watching ./run,  and all three must
be running as root. There is no way around this, pretty much anything either
of the tools does requires root privileges.

Set PATH=.:$PATH to let ifmon run wsupp.
Run ../misc/sockmod in current direction with devel config.

It is possible to run wsupp as a standalone process, but it won't be able
to trigger dhcp, so dhcp (the one from ../temp/wifi/, or ifctl -q) should
be run manually if a usable connection is needed. The control tool will
not be able to auto-start the service, and won't handle start/stop commands
because those are actually passed to ifmon.

When auto-starting the service, wifi expects ./run/wsupp to become writable
soon after it appears. Without sockmod running, the service will be started
but the socket won't be chmod()ed and wifi won't be able to connect.
Chmod or chown it manually and retry. Pre-configure iface with ifctl
(or use wifi start) to skip auto-start.

Avoid running wsupp on devices already handled by wpa_supplicant.
There's no interlocking. In systemd-based distros, avoid running ifmon
in parallel with networkd, or at least do not attempt to debug dhcp while
doing so. Beware networkd is often configured as socket-activated and may
get restarted when DHCP reply arrives.
