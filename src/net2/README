Why combined ifmon + dhcp client?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dropping DHCP-obtained addresses on carrier-down is quite important for some
use cases, wifi in particular. A DHCP client capable of monitoring link carrier
status is something like 90% of ifmon already.

The actual interface-monitoring part of ifmon is simple and hardly warrants
a separate service. Much easier to just piggy-back it onto the dhcp client.
