.SH DESCRIPTION
This tool handles client-side WPA2-PSK interface setup with CCMP pairwise
key and TKIP group key.
.P
Given the command above, \fBwpa\fR tunes interface \fIwlp1s0\fR to
\fI5180\fR MHz and tries to connect to station with bssid
\fI00:11:22:33:44:55\fR and ssid "\fIBlackhole\fR". Upon successful
connection, it performs EAPOL key exchange with the station
and configures the interface to encrypt the traffic.
.P
The tools expects 32-byte pre-shared key (PSK) in hex notation.
For passphrase-based configuration, the key must be derived from
the passphrase first.
