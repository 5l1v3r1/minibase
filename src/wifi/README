Wi-Fi monitor / wpa supplicant / connection manager.

The purpose of this tool is to allow connecting the newly booted system
to a wifi (or maybe wired) network, preferably with as little configuration
as possible.

These tools may or may not face a major rewrite soon, namely splitting
the wifi part and the generic link part. Regardless, it should be reasonably
usable with its current design -- and the re-written version will likely
be somewhat larger. See ../../doc/wimon.txt on this.
See also ../../doc/wpadhcp.txt for some unresolved issues with wimon design.
