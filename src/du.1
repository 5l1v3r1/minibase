.SH NAME
du \- estimate disk usage
'''
.SH SYNOPSIS
du [\fB-scbnda\fR] [\fIfile\fR ...]
'''
.SH DESCRIPTION
du gives a rough estimate of how much disk space given \fIfile\fR(s) take.
In case \fIfile\fR is a directory, the total disk usage of the whole subtree
under that directory is shown. Symlinks are never followed.
.P
Beware the size shown by this tool is merely an estimate obtained from either
st_blocks or (with \fB-a\fR) st_size field of struct stat (see \fBstat\fR(2)).
The actual space usage depends on the underlying file system and may be off
in either direction.
