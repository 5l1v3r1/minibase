Virtual terminal multiplexer (vtmux) spawns VT-grabbing clients,
provides them with access to KMS/input devices, and allows the user
to switch between VTs.

Since VT-grabbing clients are usually user sessions, vtmux also
indirectly deals with user logins. Within systemd the equivalent
tool is called "logind".

Viewed other way, vtmux (current implementation at least) is
a multi-client version of weston-launch.

See ../../doc/vtmux.txt for more detailed description,
and ../../doc/login.txt on how it fits within the planned
user session management infrastructure.



Test-running vtmux is only possible on a dedicated box with some
sort of remote command access (ssh etc). Make sure no other process
(logind) is trying to manage VTs. There are sample script in ./etc,
adjust them to match the host configuration. Upon startup, current
version of vtmux will open /dev/tty0 so it's ok to run it directly
from the ssh session. vtmux can only run as root.

Use ./unlock to re-enable kernel controlled VT switching in case
vtmux stops working and leaves VT switching locked.
