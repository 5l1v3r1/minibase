Virtual terminal multiplexer (vtmux) spawns VT-grabbing clients,
provides them with access to KMS/input devices, and allows the user
to switch between VTs.

Since VT-grabbing clients are usually user sessions, vtmux also
indirectly deals with user logins. Within systemd the equivalent
tool is called "logind".

Viewed another way, vtmux is a multi-client version of weston-launch.

See ../../doc/vtmux.txt for more detailed description,
and ../../doc/login.txt on how it fits within the planned
user session management infrastructure.



Test-running vtmux is only possible on a dedicated box with some
sort of remote command access (ssh etc). Make sure no other process
(logind) is trying to manage the VTs. There are sample scripts in ./etc,
adjust them to match the host configuration. Current version of vtmux
should run just fine right out of the ssh session.

Naturally vtmux can only run as root.

Use ./unlock to re-enable kernel controlled VT switching in case
vtmux stops working and leaves VT switching locked.
