Virtual terminal multiplexer (vtmux) spawns VT-grabbing clients,
provides them with access to KMS/input devices, and allows the user
to switch between VTs.

Since VT-grabbing clients are usually user sessions, vtmux also
indirectly deals with user logins. Within systemd the equivalent
tool is called "logind".

Viewed other way, vtmux (current implementation at least) is a multi-client
version of wayland-lauch.

See ../../doc/vtmux.txt for more detailed description,
and ../../doc/login.txt on how it fits within the planned
user session management infrastructure.

Current status: *INCOMPLETE*, missing client communication
(and clients to communicate with for that matter).
